# Tompiler Readme

Tompiler will be a relatively simple compiler built for educational and explorative purposes. 

## Compiling

Compiler configurations are stored in the .bat files. There are two of them.
 - runTests.bat compiles and runs the tests. 
 - compile.bat compiles and runs the code. 

## Using

Running `compile.bat` will run the compiler after executing. You can also find the executable, `fileopen.exe`, in your `bin` directory.

It takes up to two command line arguments. The first argument can be an input file path while the second argument can be an output file path.

Place the `bin` directory on your system path if you want to be able to run tompiler from anywhere.
