 - added removeExtension function and tests
 - confirmed getchar will read an 'enter'. 
 - thomas fixed prompting function to accept alternate inputs
 - added backupFile function and tests
 - Included tests for filepaths with directories
 - redid filenameHasExtension. It now allows for filenames like ".bob" and doesnt allow filenames that end in slashes. It does allow folders to have '.'s in them.

- added #pragma region directives to header files. This is basically just markup for VSCode. Each of these regions can now be folded in Visual Studio or VSCode. This does not affect -ansi compilation on MinGW-W64 gcc; as far as I can tell. The purpose is to make the code much easier to navigate without relying on tab-based folding. [See Also: stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63512637/what-is-pragma-region-in-c-and-vscode)
- Cleaned up comments, tab-based folding, etc.
- Fixed up the `addExtension` to use malloc to create a longer, concatenated string out of its inputs. Added unit tests for `addExtension`. 
- Refactored std swapping test utility functions. The best way to test a prompter is now to use is to call `setSTDin3`, get the value, then dont forget to call `restoreSTD3()` _before_ making a test-based assertion. 


1/20/2023 : All group members in collaboration
- created `promptUserOverwriteSelection`.
- created tests for `promptUserOverwriteSelection`. This was quite an involved task because we had to figure out how to temporarily replace stdin and stdout with alternative files so that we could test functionalities like `scanf`. Ultimately we were able to figure it out.
